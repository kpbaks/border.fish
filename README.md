# border.fish

A [fish](https://fishshell.com/) plugin that draws a border after each run command.
The border is only drawn if the command takes longer than `BORDER_MIN_CMD_DURATION` milliseconds to execute, or if the terminal has more than `BORDER_MIN_COLUMNS` columns.
If the previous command exceeds `BORDER_MIN_CMD_DURATION` milliseconds, the border will be drawn and the duration of the command will be displayed in the border.
If the previous command exited with a non-zero status, the border will be drawn in red, and the exit status will be displayed in the border.
If the previous command was not found in the `$PATH`, the border will be drawn in yellow.

## Installation

```fish
fisher install kpbaks/border.fish
```
