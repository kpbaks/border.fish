# border.fish

A [fish](https://fishshell.com/) plugin that draws a border after each run command. \
If the previous command exceeds `BORDER_MIN_CMD_DURATION` milliseconds, the duration of the command will be displayed in the border. \
If the previous command exited with a non-zero status, the border will be drawn in red, and the exit status will be displayed in the border. \
If the previous command was not found in the `$PATH`, the border will be drawn in yellow.

## Installation

```fish
fisher install kpbaks/border.fish
```

## Customization
